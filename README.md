# DYOM Cli
This is a simple CLI which uses a pretrained object detector which utilises tensorflow
to output an analysed picture.

All users have to do is install the current cli (dyom) and the relevant libraries for this cli to work, like tensorflow.

Following that, pass the image link u want scanned as the argument after calling dyom
e.g. "dyom aabbbcc.jpg"

wait for a few minutes and voila the image you selected will be output with boxes drawn around the objects in the photo
